# CrossERC721

An ERC721 implementation that allows for cross-chain transfers of NFTs.

## We used

1. Router Protocol's [Cross-Talk Library](http://devnet-docs.routerprotocol.com/crosstalk) for cross-chain communication.
2. Hardhat for Smart Contract compilation and deployment.
3. Solidity for Smart Contract development.
4. Polygon Mumbai Testnet and Avalanche Fuji Testnet for deployment.

## Here are the deployments

1. Polygon Mumbai Testnet
   1. Contract Address => 0xB905345D930707C992ec768Cf748AaBc0D3207Da
   2. Verified [Link](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xB905345D930707C992ec768Cf748AaBc0D3207Da#code)
2. Avalanche Fuji Testnet
   1. Contract Address => 0xC0438dF8A5008Af185B36F4f2C38be410C9ce95d
   2. Verified [Link](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xC0438dF8A5008Af185B36F4f2C38be410C9ce95d#code)
